3. One thing that can be noted about the probabilities is that quite a few words have extremely low probabilities, and this pattern persists even more pronouncedly when stopwords are eliminated. In other words, the removal of stopwords doesn't dramatically change the pattern in which many of the words in the text have a low likelihood of occurrence. This shows that the text has a varied vocabulary with a lengthy tail of uncommon terms, which is a common feature of material written in natural language.
4. The statement "If a belief is true, it can be deduced it is universal" with a probability of 0.00000000002 appears to be an estimation of the probability of encountering this specific sentence in the text.
